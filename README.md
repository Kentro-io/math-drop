# 🧠 BrainSpark

**Open-source mini-games that teach kids the skill AI can't replace: problem solving.**

🎮 **[Play now](https://kentro-io.github.io/brainspark)** -- works on any device, no install needed.

## Why This Exists

AI can write essays, generate code, and pass exams. But it can't think through a problem it's never seen before.

In a world where AI handles the routine, the kids who thrive will be the ones who can **break down problems, think fast, and find patterns**. That's not memorization. That's problem solving under pressure.

BrainSpark is a growing collection of mini-games that train exactly that. Each game targets a different aspect of problem solving. They feel like games, not homework. And they build the kind of thinking that no AI can do for you.

**This is the most valuable skill your kid can practice in the age of AI.**

## 🎮 Games

### 🧮 Math Drop
Equations fall from the sky. Solve them before they hit the ground. Covers Pre-K through 5th grade with 10 levels per grade. Starts with `1 + 2`, ends with `144 ÷ 12`.

| Grade | Ages | What They Learn |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 🌱 Pre-K | 3-5 | Counting, simple addition |
| 🌿 Kindergarten | 5-6 | Addition & subtraction to 10 |
| 🌳 1st Grade | 6-7 | Addition & subtraction to 20 |
| 🪴 2nd Grade | 7-8 | Two-digit problems, intro to multiplication |
| 🌲 3rd Grade | 8-9 | Multiplication & division |
| 🏔️ 4th Grade | 9-10 | Multi-digit operations, larger numbers |
| 🚀 5th Grade | 10-11 | All operations, speed and complexity |

## Get Involved

Math Drop is just the first game. BrainSpark is meant to grow into a full collection of mini-games, and the possibilities are wide open. Here are some ideas to get you thinking:

**New game ideas:**
- 🧩 **Pattern games** that train pattern recognition and sequence completion
- 🔤 **Word games** that build vocabulary and mental flexibility under time pressure
- 🧠 **Memory games** that stretch working memory with progressively harder sequences
- 🔀 **Logic puzzles** with rule-based challenges that train conditional thinking
- 📐 **Estimation games** that build number sense and spatial reasoning
- 🧱 **Visual programming** puzzles where kids drag and drop logic blocks to solve challenges

Games don't have to be "falling" mechanics. Any format works: matching, sorting, building, racing, drawing. The only requirement is that it makes kids think harder and have fun doing it.

**Other ways to contribute:**
- 🎨 **Design** -- animations, themes, accessibility, sound effects
- 🧮 **Content** -- new grade levels (6th+), word problems, fractions, decimals
- 🌍 **Localization** -- translate to other languages so more kids can play
- 🐛 **Bug fixes** -- find something broken? PRs welcome
- 💡 **Ideas** -- open an issue with your feature suggestion

The goal is simple: every kid on earth should have access to free, high-quality tools that make them better thinkers. No paywalls, no subscriptions, no premium tiers.
