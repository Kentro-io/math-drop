# 🧠 MindLab

**Open-source mini-games that teach kids the skill AI can't replace: problem solving.**

🎮 **[Play now](https://kentro-io.github.io/mindlab)** — works on any device, no install needed.

## Why This Exists

AI can write essays, generate code, and pass exams. But it can't think through a problem it's never seen before.

In a world where AI handles the routine, the kids who thrive will be the ones who can **break down problems, think fast, and find patterns**. That's not memorization. That's problem solving under pressure.

MindLab is a growing collection of mini-games that train exactly that. Each game targets a different aspect of problem solving — mental math, pattern recognition, logic, memory, estimation. They feel like games, not homework. And they build the kind of thinking that no AI can do for you.

**This is the most valuable skill your kid can practice in the age of AI.**

## 🎮 Games

### 🧮 Math Drop *(live now)*
Equations fall from the sky. Solve them before they hit the ground. Covers Pre-K through 5th grade with 10 levels per grade. Starts with `1 + 2`, ends with `144 ÷ 12`.

| Grade | Ages | What They Learn |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 🌱 Pre-K | 3-5 | Counting, simple addition |
| 🌿 Kindergarten | 5-6 | Addition & subtraction to 10 |
| 🌳 1st Grade | 6-7 | Addition & subtraction to 20 |
| 🪴 2nd Grade | 7-8 | Two-digit problems, intro to multiplication |
| 🌲 3rd Grade | 8-9 | Multiplication & division |
| 🏔️ 4th Grade | 9-10 | Multi-digit operations, larger numbers |
| 🚀 5th Grade | 10-11 | All operations, speed and complexity |

### 🔮 Coming Soon

These are the mini-games we want to build next. Each one targets a different problem-solving skill:

- **🧩 Pattern Drop** — Falling shape and color sequences. Spot the pattern, complete it before it lands. Trains pattern recognition, the foundation of all logical thinking.

- **🔤 Word Drop** — Scrambled letters fall from the top. Unscramble them into real words before time runs out. Builds mental flexibility and vocabulary under pressure.

- **🧠 Memory Drop** — A sequence flashes briefly on screen, then disappears. Recreate it from memory. Progressively longer sequences that stretch working memory.

- **🔀 Logic Drop** — Simple rule-based puzzles: "if red, swipe left; if blue, swipe right; if green, tap twice." Rules change every few levels. Trains conditional thinking — the same skill behind programming and debugging.

- **📐 Estimate Drop** — How many dots? How long is this line? How heavy is this object? Make your best guess before the timer runs out. Builds number sense and spatial reasoning.

- **🧱 Code Drop** — Drag-and-drop code blocks to guide a character through a maze. No syntax, just logic. Sequence, loops, and conditionals as puzzle pieces. Intro to computational thinking.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Features

- **Multi-user profiles** — siblings each get their own avatar, grade level, and progress
- **Works everywhere** — phone, tablet, laptop, Chromebook
- **Install as PWA** — offline play, feels like a native app
- **Zero ads, zero tracking** — no data collection, ever
- **No accounts needed** — everything stays on device

## Get Involved

Math Drop is just the beginning. MindLab is designed to become a full arcade of brain-building mini-games, and we need help making that happen.

**Build a new game:**
The architecture is intentionally simple (vanilla JS, no frameworks) so anyone can contribute. Pick a game from the "Coming Soon" list above, or pitch your own. Each game is self-contained — you don't need to understand the whole codebase.

**Other ways to contribute:**
- 🎨 **Design** — animations, themes, accessibility, sound effects
- 🧮 **Content** — new grade levels (6th+), word problems, fractions, decimals
- 🌍 **Localization** — translate to other languages so more kids can play
- 🐛 **Bug fixes** — find something broken? PRs welcome
- 💡 **Ideas** — open an issue with your feature suggestion

The goal is simple: every kid on earth should have access to free, high-quality tools that make them better thinkers. No paywalls, no subscriptions, no "premium tiers."

## Tech Stack

Pure vanilla JS, HTML, CSS. No frameworks, no build step, no dependencies. Open `index.html` and play.

- **PWA** — installable, works offline
- **LocalStorage** — all progress stays on device
- **Responsive** — adapts to any screen size
- **Touch + Keyboard** — works on both

## Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kentro-io/mindlab.git
cd mindlab
open index.html
```

No `npm install`. No build. No environment variables. Just HTML.

## License

MIT — use it, fork it, put it in your school, teach your kids, teach other people's kids.
