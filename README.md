# 🧮 Math Drop

**An open-source math game that teaches kids the skill AI can't replace: problem solving.**

🎮 **[Play now](https://kentro-io.github.io/math-drop)** — works on any device, no install needed.

## Why This Exists

AI can write essays, generate code, and pass exams. But it can't think through a problem it's never seen before.

In a world where AI handles the routine, the kids who thrive will be the ones who can **break down problems, think fast, and find patterns**. That's not memorization. That's problem solving under pressure.

Math Drop trains exactly that. Equations fall from the sky. Solve them before they hit the ground. Start easy, get fast. Your brain builds pathways that no chatbot can build for you.

**This is the most valuable skill your kid can practice in the age of AI.** And it feels like a game, not homework.

## How It Works

🎯 **Falling equations** — math problems drop from the top of the screen. Type the answer before they reach the bottom.

📈 **10 levels per grade** — starts gentle, gets intense. Speed increases, numbers get bigger, operations get harder.

👶 **Pre-K through 5th Grade** — age-appropriate progression from counting (`1 + 2`) to multi-step problems (`144 ÷ 12`).

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Multi-user profiles** — siblings can each have their own avatar, grade level, and progress. No accounts needed, everything stays on device.

📱 **Works everywhere** — phone, tablet, laptop, Chromebook. Install as a PWA for offline play. Zero ads, zero tracking, zero data collection.

## Grades & Progression

| Grade | Ages | What They Learn |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 🌱 Pre-K | 3-5 | Counting, simple addition |
| 🌿 Kindergarten | 5-6 | Addition & subtraction to 10 |
| 🌳 1st Grade | 6-7 | Addition & subtraction to 20 |
| 🪴 2nd Grade | 7-8 | Two-digit problems, intro to multiplication |
| 🌲 3rd Grade | 8-9 | Multiplication & division |
| 🏔️ 4th Grade | 9-10 | Multi-digit operations, larger numbers |
| 🚀 5th Grade | 10-11 | All operations, speed and complexity |

Each grade has 10 levels that progressively increase speed, number range, and active equations.

## Get Involved

This is open source because every kid deserves access to quality learning tools, not just kids whose parents can afford app subscriptions.
